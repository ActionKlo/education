# Summary

## Single Responsibility Principle

- A type should only have one reason to change
- _Separation of concerns_ - different types/packages handling different, independent tasks/problems

## Open Close Principle
 
- Types should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- You should be able to substitute an embedding type in place of its embedded part

## Interface Segregation Principle

- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- _YAGNI_ - You Ain't Going to Need It

## Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level module should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
